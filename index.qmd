## Introduction


#### *Diversity at work and its implications for recruitment* (DIREK)

- Christian Albrekt Larsen 
- Jeevitha Yogachandiran Qvist

<br>

Two workpackages: 

::: {.incremental}

<br>

1. **How diverse are Danish workplaces across gender, age, and immigrant origin, in the period from 1996 to 2022?**

2. <span style="color: grey;">How does the diversity at *management* and *employee levels* affect the recruitment of new employees, and how are these relationships conditioned by the workplace's organization, recruitment practices, and degree of competitive exposure?</span>

Research paper: *What drives changes in workplace segregation?* (todays presentation)
</div>

<div class="fragment">
> <span style="color: black;">When the labor force becomes more diverse, does this diversity naturally "trickle down" into more diverse *workplaces* through competitive labor market processes (*pool effects*; supply-driven integration), or does different groups continue to be sorted into their own respective workplaces and labor market segments (*sorting effects*; demand-driven segregation).</span>
</div>

## Segregated workplaces and motivation 

::: {.incremental}

- Similar to, yet different from, segregated **occupations** and/or **sectors**
    - Sectors, occupations, and workplaces all measure the uneven distribution of demographic groups across labor market positions
    - Can be quantified using similar indices (dissimilarity, isolation, entropy)
    - All three have been invoked to explain wage gaps, inequality, and social stratification.
    - *Abstraction defined by classification schemes vs. distribution across actual* **physical establishments**

:::

## Segregated workplaces and motivation 

::: {.incremental}

- Core intrest is **intergroup exposure in daily life**
    - Who works together at the same *place* (address) at the same *time* 
    - For **contact theory**, workplace segregation is what matters

- Occupational segregation reveals only the **aggregate distribution** of what workers are called
    - An occupation may appear integrated in aggregate while individual workplaces remain highly segregated

- Workplace segregation is **not simply a more granular version of occupational segregation**
    - Workers in the same workplace often occupy different occupations (nurse, administrator, janitor)
    - Workers in the same occupation often work at different workplaces

## Two competing frameworks

- Rooted in **neoclassical labor market theory**(ies) $^1$
- Discrimination is "expensive" → competitive markets erode it
- Workers seek **jobs matching** their skills; employers seek the best match
- **Prediction:** As underrepresented groups grow in the labor force, workplace composition follows

## An illustration 

A hypothetical and stylized example of **recruitment in an high-skilled "engineering workplace"** in the context *of engineering graduates having changed from being 90% male to 70% male over the last 20 years*

<br>

**Pool effects**

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

<div class="fragment">
The workplace will "naturally" include a greater number of female engineers as **the company hires from the changing graduate student pool** and the demographics of the workplace will continue to **reflect the demographic trends of the population over time**.
</div>

</div>

:::

::: column
**Sorting effects**

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

<div class="fragment">
The company will **continue to hire male engineers** as they have always done and therefore **female engineers will cluster in other workplaces**.

</div>

## Four hypotheses structure the study (and this presentation)

## Hypotheses (1)

> **H1a** (*Pool Effects*): <span style="color: black;">Workplace **segregation will decrease** as labor force diversity increases, reflecting the competitive translation of supply-side demographic shifts into workplace representation.</span> 

> **H1b** (*Sorting Effects*): <span style="color: black;">Workplace **segregation will remain stable or increase** despite growing labor force diversity, reflecting demand-side mechanisms that maintain segregated employment structures independent of labor pool composition.</span> 

---

It not enough that a previously underrepresented groups becomes bigger, the group must also, on average, have the skills to be a match for different type of workplaces. 

- If no men have a nursing degree, they cannot work as a nurse. 
- If no immigrants get a degree in child-care, they cannot work in child-care. 

Two pathways to workplace segregation help further **tease-out pool and sorting effects** in a context of changing demographic composition of the workforce and changing levels of segregation: 

1. ***Skill-mediated allocations***, and 
2. ***Residual Sorting***

:::

<br>

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Key question:** How much segregation remains after accounting for skill differences?

**Note:**  Skill refers to both *level of education* and type of *occupation/degree*
:::

---

### 1. Skill-mediated sorting

**Segregation as a by-product of skill matching**

- Demographic groups differ in education, credentials, experience
- Jobs requiring specific skills cluster at specific workplaces
- Workers sort into workplaces based on qualifications
- **Result:** *Segregation occurs without discriminatory intent*


::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Example:** If immigrants have lower host-country credential recognition on average, and low-credential jobs concentrate at certain workplaces, immigrant-native segregation emerges through skill matching alone.
:::

---

### 2. Residual Sorting

**Segregation beyond what skills can explain** (*unobservables*)

- **Taste-based discrimination:** Employer preferences for/against certain groups 
- **Statistical discrimination:** Using group membership as a proxy for unobserved productivity 
- **Network reproduction:** Referral-based hiring reproduces existing demographics through homophily 
- **Employee preferences:** Workers prefer colleagues from same group 

## Hypotheses (2)

> **H2** (*Skill Sorting Hypothesis*): <span style="color: black;">The relative contribution of skill-mediated versus residual sorting varies by demographic group. Specifically:</span> 

> (a) *Immigrants*: Segregation is primarily **explained by education** (credential recognition, education mismatch)

> (b) *Women*: Segregation is primarily **explained by occupation** (occupational channeling, gendering of professions/educations)

> (c) *Seniors*: Segregation reflects both skill- and residual sorting (skill depreciation and age-based sorting)

---

## Structural moderators

**Segregation is not only a product of who workers are—it also depends on where they work.**


- $H2$ focus on *worker-level* mechanisms (skills, networks, preferences)
- Segregation processes is expected to vary by *workplace-level* characteristics
- The same demographic group may experience different sorting dynamics depending on organizational context

<br>

**Workplaces differ in:**

- **Size** 
- **Skill composition**
- *Hiring formalization*
- *Regulatory exposure*
- *Turnover rates*

## Hypothesis (3)

<br>

> **H3:** (*Workplace Size Hypothesis*): <span style="color: black;">Between-workplace segregation decreases with organizational size.</span> 

- **Visibility pressure:** Subject to regulatory scrutiny, ESG reporting, public accountability
- **More hiring decisions:** Greater opportunity for workforce composition to adjust to labor pool changes
- **Less network hiring:** Small workplaces rely more on referrals, which reproduce existing demographics through homophily

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Countervailing forces:** Large workplaces have internal hierarchies that enable *within-workplace* segregation across departments, even when overall representation looks balanced
:::

---

## Hypothesis (4)

<br>

> **H4** (*Workplace Skill-Level Hypothesis*): <span style="color: black;">The level of segregation varies systematically across workplace skill-levels, with group-specific patterns:</span> 

<br>

**Two competing mechanisms:**

<br>

| | High-skill workplaces | Low-skill workplaces |
|---|---|---|
| **Reducing segregation** | Formalized, credential-based hiring limits network effects and taste-based discrimination | — |
| **Increasing segregation** | Credential requirements exclude groups with limited access to recognition | Informal hiring, weak oversight, secondary labor markets enable discriminatory sorting |

## Denmark as a most likely case?

**If pool effects operate anywhere, they should operate here.**

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- **Legal framework:** Comprehensive anti-discrimination laws, explicit "inclusive labor market" policy 

- **Tight labor markets:** Unemployment fell from >10% (1990s) to 2–3%—employers must draw from a broad labor pool

- **Demographic change:** Clear variation in labor pool composition

:::

---

| Group | 1996 | 2022 |
|-------|------|------|
| Immigrants | 3.7% | 16.4% |
| Seniors (55+) | 12.0% | 21.1% |
| Women | ~50% | ~50% |

---

<br>

### **The flexicurity model**

::: columns
::: column

**Flexibility**

- Weak employment protection
- Easy to hire and fire

:::
::: column

**Security**

- Generous unemployment insurance
- Active labor market policy
- Workers can refuse bad matches

:::
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Implication:** High turnover enables sorting to occur continuously if workplaces adjust composition through *selective retention* and *termination*.
:::

---

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}

Denmark provides a strong test because pool effects have *every advantage*:

- If segregation persists despite legal protections, tight labor markets, and massive demographic shifts → sorting effects dominate

- If workplaces become proportionally representative → pool effects dominate

:::

# Design

## Data

<br>

**Integrated Database for Labour Market Research (IDA)**

- Employer-employee linked dataset covering all Danish workers
- Annual observations with accurate workplace identification

**Register-based Labour Force Statistics (RAS)**

- Standardized labor force classifications (international standards)
- Complements IDA with occupation and industry codes

**Coverage:** 1996–2022

---

### Sample construction

<br>

**Restriction:** Establishments with 50+ (full-time) employees

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Why large workplaces?**

- Stable exposure measures (small workplaces → noisy estimates)
- Formalized HR policies and hiring practices
- ESG reporting requirements
- Higher turnover → more hiring decisions observed
:::

**N:** 29,000 unique workplaces, 3,8 million unique workers over the time period. (12,000 and 1,500,000 in 2022)

Represents approximately half of the Danish workforce

---

### Demographic classifications

| Group | Definition | Reference group |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Gender** | Female (administrative record) | Male |
| **Immigrant** | First generation (foreign-born, no Danish parent) + descendants (Danish-born, no Danish parent) | Danish origins (one or both parents Danish-born) |
| **Senior** | Age 55 or older | Age below 55 |

---

### Skill dimensions

<br>

Three measures capture worker and workplace skill levels:

**1. Education** (HFUDD classification)

- Basic (ISCED 0–2)
- Vocational (ISCED 3–4)
- Short-term tertiary (ISCED 5)
- Medium-long term tertiary (ISCED 6–8)

**2. Occupation** (ISCO-08, 1-digit)

- 10 categories: Managers, Professionals, Technicians, Clerical, Service/Sales, Agriculture, Craft/Trades, Operators, Elementary, Armed Forces

---

### Workplace skill index

Composite measure of workplace skill level

<br>

| Component | Weight | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Average educational attainment | 60% | HFUDD |
| Median income | 20% | IDA |
| Occupation rank | 20% | ILO ISCO-08 skill ranking |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Note**: Currently limited to 1996-2007 while robostness checks is done on the construction of the measure from 2008-2022.
:::
## Measuring Segregation and Intergroup Exposure

---

### Step 1: Who are your coworkers?

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

For each worker, I calculate the share of coworkers from a given demographic group:

$$
\text{Share}_{iwt} = \frac{\sum_{j \neq i \in w} \mathbb{1}(group_j = g)}{n_w - 1}
$$

This is calculated for every worker, regardless of their own group membership.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Example:** A 10-person workplace with 4 women

- A **woman** in this workplace has 3/9 = 33% female coworkers
- A **man** in this workplace has 4/9 = 44% female coworkers
:::

</div>

---

### Step 2: Isolation and Exposure

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

I then aggregate these shares separately for in-group and out-group members:

**Isolation (I)** — Average share of in-group coworkers for **in-group members**

$$I = \frac{1}{N_g}\sum_{i \in g} \text{Share}_{iwt}$$

**Exposure (E)** — Average share of in-group coworkers for **out-group members**

$$E = \frac{1}{N_{\neg g}}\sum_{i \notin g} \text{Share}_{iwt}$$

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Example (Women, 2022):**

- **I = 63%**: The average woman has 63% female coworkers
- **E = 37%**: The average man has 37% female coworkers
:::

</div>

---

### Step 3: Segregation as a gap in experience

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

$$
S = I - E
$$

Segregation measures the **gap** in exposure to a group between in-group and out-group members.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Continuing the example:**

- S = 63% − 37% = **26 percentage points**

**Interpretation:**

- Women have 26 pp more female coworkers than men do
- Or: a woman is **1.70×** as likely to have a female coworker as a man is (63 ÷ 37)
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**What does S tell us?**

- **S = 0** → In-group and out-group have identical coworker composition (no segregation)
- **S > 0** → In-group members encounter more of their own group than out-group members do
- **S = 100** → Complete segregation (in-group only works with in-group)
:::

</div>

---

### Step 4: Benchmarking against chance

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

Some segregation **occurs by chance alone** due to workplace size variation and geography. I simulate random assignment (fixed workplace sizes and regions) to establish a baseline.

$$
S^{E} = \frac{S^{\text{observed}} - S^{\text{simulated}}}{100 - S^{\text{simulated}}}
$$

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Example:**

- Observed: I = 63%, E = 37%, S = 26%
- Simulated (random): I = 52%, E = 48%, S = 4%
- Maximum possible: S = 100%

$$S^{E} = \frac{26 - 4}{100 - 4} = \frac{22}{96} = 23\%$$

About a quarter of all *possible* excess segregation is realized.

---

### Interpreting the Index

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

**What does $S^E$ tell us about a worker's experience?**

| $S^E$ Value | Experience |
|-------------|------------|
| ≈ 0% | In-group and out-group members encounter the same coworker mix |
| ≈ 50% | In-group members encounter substantially more of their own group |
| ≈ 100% | In-group members work almost exclusively with their own group |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Note:** In this sample (workplaces with 50+ employees), $S$ and $S^E$ are nearly identical. Large workplaces produce minimal "segregation by chance"—random assignment would make coworker composition converge toward population averages. Virtually all observed segregation reflects **systematic sorting**, not statistical noise.
:::

</div>

<!---
---

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

**Concrete examples (2022):**

| Group | In-group (I) | Out-group (E) | $S^E$ | Likelihood |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|------------|
| Women | 63% female coworkers | 37% female coworkers | **26%** | 1.70× more likely |
| Immigrants | 30% immigrant coworkers | 13% immigrant coworkers | **17%** | 2.31× more likely |
| Seniors | 29% senior coworkers | 22% senior coworkers | **7%** | 1.32× more likely |

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Reading the table:** An immigrant is **2.3 times as likely** to have an immigrant coworker as a non-immigrant is—yet $S^E$ = 17% means immigrants are only 17% of the way from random mixing to complete segregation.
:::

</div>
--->

---

### Conditional segregation analysis

To answer whether segregation is driven by skill differences or by other mechanisms, I randomly reassign workers *within* skill categories, holding workplace skill composition fixed: *A nurse could only be assigned to workplaces that employ nurse, etc.*

<!---
<div style="font-size: 0.75em;">

1. Define ~40 skill cells (education × occupation combinations)
2. Randomly reassign workers within each cell to workplaces
3. Compute segregation under this constrained assignment
4. Repeat 100 times to obtain $S^{\text{conditional}}$

</div>
--->

The gap between **observed** and this **conditional baseline** tells us how much segregation is *skill-mediated*. What remains after conditioning is *residual*

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- 0% → Skills explain nothing
- 100% → Skills explain everything
:::

<!---
---

### Measures

**Conditional effective segregation:**

$$
S^{E|skill} = \frac{S^{\text{observed}} - S^{\text{conditional}}}{100 - S^{\text{simulated}}}
$$

**Share explained by skills:**

$$
\text{Share explained} = 1 - \frac{S^{E|skill}}{S^{E}}
$$

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- 0% → Skills explain nothing
- 100% → Skills explain everything

Despite decades of gender equality policy, female segregation barely moved. For immigrants and seniors, segregation *increased* as their labor force share grew.

Both level and trend are concerning
Reading: Active sorting into niches as the immigrant workforce expands; segregation intensifying with demographic growth



The Paradox
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Key insight: The group with the highest segregation (women) is the only one improving. The groups with lower starting points (immigrants, seniors) are worsening.
This suggests different mechanisms:

Women: Longstanding, institutionalized segregation that policy may be slowly eroding
Immigrants/Seniors: Dynamic sorting that responds to demographic change—the labor market channels new entrants into niches

### Interpretation

::: {.incremental}
- Results align with **segmented labor market theory**: albeit not to extreme extents, *demographic groups increasingly concentrate in distinct organizational niches*

- Increased national diversity does **not** translate to workplace integration

- Instead, growth in group size appears to **deepen** segregation as groups are channeled into separate segments of the labor market
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Bottom line:** Pool effects are overwhelmed by sorting effects for immigrants and seniors. The labor market absorbs demographic change by *segregating* rather than *integrating*.

### Gender segregation: *Horizontal sorting*

| Component | Explained |
|-----------|-----------|
| Education | 3% |
| Occupation | 23% (28% in 1996) |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Interpretation:** Gender segregation operates *horizontally*—men and women have similar education levels but sort into different occupations and workplaces.

The large residual suggests self-selection into family-friendly workplaces, gendering of work, or gendered recruitment networks [@pan2015gender; @usui2008job].
:::

---

### Immigrant segregation: *Vertical sorting*

<br>

| Component | Explained |
|-----------|-----------|
| Education | 56% (31% in 1996)  |
| Occupation | 8% |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Interpretation:** Immigrant segregation operates *vertically*—driven by credential gaps and foreign qualification barriers.

The increasing role of education over time suggests generational convergence may reduce segregation. Remaining residual may reflect discrimination or ethnic recruitment networks.
:::

---

### Senior segregation: *Mechanisms unrelated to skills?*

<br>

| Component | Explained |
|-----------|-----------|
| Education | 12% (<1% in 1996) |
| Occupation | 8% |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Interpretation:** Age-based sorting is largely *unrelated* to measurable human capital.

Primary mechanisms likely include cohort-specific labor market attachment, technological displacement, or employer stereotypes about older workers.
:::

---

### Group-specific sorting pathways

<br>

| Group | Primary pathway | *Possible* mechanism | Residual |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Women** | Horizontal | Occupational differentiation | 73% |
| **Immigrants** | Vertical | Credential gaps | 43% |
| **Seniors** | Non-skill | Cohort/life decisions | >85% |

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**H2 supported:** Sorting mechanisms differ systematically across groups—occupational for gender, educational for immigrants, and largely non-observable for seniors.
:::





## H3: Workplace size

**Does segregation decrease with organizational scale?**

---

![](fig_sized_wom.svg)

---

![](fig_sized_imm.svg)

---

![](fig_sized_sen.svg)

---

![](fig_sized.svg)

---

- **All groups:** Larger workplaces → lower segregation
- Supports pool effects mechanism: scale enables diversification
- **Exception:** Gender segregation increases slightly between 500–999 and 1000+ employees


::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**H3 supported:** Organizational scale moderates segregation—larger workplaces show stronger integration, consistent with formalized hiring, regulatory pressure, and reduced reliance on network recruitment.
:::

---

## H4: Workplace skill level

**Does segregation vary across the skill spectrum?**

NOTE: *this is preliminar results and robustness test are being done on the workplace skill index measure*

| **Seniors** | U-shape in early years, approaching linear pattern by 2022 (Insignificant) | - |

"This figure shows how segregation varies across the skill spectrum for each group—and the shapes are strikingly different.
For women, we see an inverted U. Segregation peaks in mid-skill workplaces and is lower at both extremes. This is where gendered occupational queues and devaluation mechanisms operate most strongly.
For immigrants, the pattern is a U-shape, but heavily asymmetric. There's concentration at both ends of the skill spectrum, but the low-skill side dominates. At the high end, credential recognition barriers limit access. At the low end, network-based hiring channels immigrants into ethnic occupational niches.
For seniors, the pattern has shifted over time. In 1996, shown by the dashed line, we see a classic U-shape—seniors were polarized, retained in high-skill positions through accumulated expertise but also pushed into low-skill roles. By 2022, the solid line, this has flattened into a near-linear decline. Seniors are now predominantly concentrated in low-skill workplaces, suggesting increased downward channeling over time.
Each shape tells a different story about how sorting operates—horizontal for gender, vertical-asymmetric for immigrants, and shifting downward for seniors."

### The Core Finding

The labor market appear to absorb demographic change by **channeling groups into specific workplaces**, not by integrating them across workplaces.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Sorting effects dominate pool effects.**

Despite Denmark's tight labor markets, anti-discrimination laws, and dramatic demographic change—conditions maximally favorable to integration—workplace segregation has *increased* for immigrants and seniors.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Denmark's experience suggests a sobering conclusion:**

Demographic diversification of the labor force does not automatically produce workplace integration. Without targeted intervention addressing group-specific sorting mechanisms, increased diversity may paradoxically deepen segregation.

| Group | Level (2022) | Trend | Implication |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| **Women** | Highest (26%) | Stable/declining | Entrenched but not worsening |
| **Immigrants** | Moderate (17%) | Rising fast (+183%) | Active sorting intensifying |
| **Seniors** | Lowest (7%) | Rising (+133%) | Emerging problem? |

### Theoretical Contributions

::: {.incremental}
1. **Pool effects have limits:** Even under ideal conditions, competitive markets do not eliminate segregation
2. **Sorting is heterogeneous:** Different demographic groups experience fundamentally different mechanisms
3. **Context matters:** Workplace characteristics moderate segregation dynamics

### Future Directions

::: {.incremental}
- **Within-workplace segregation:** Do large workplaces integrate or segregate internally? (see Diop and Larsen, 2024)
- **Intersectionality:** How do multiple group memberships interact?
- **Mechanisms:** Can we directly identify discrimination vs. preferences/self-selection?

### Current struggles ...

1. Index construction 

2. Interpretation of "strength" ... is it alot? 

    What should be the baseline or point of comparison?
